Hello. My name is Roman. It`s my final project on Vue3 in Beetroot Academy Front-End development course.
This is the business card site of the travel company Travello. On this site you can get to know the company and its offers.

The project is created from components that are reused. All data is obtained dynamically from json files.
I used News API and Telegram API(data from the form is sent to the Telegram bot). RWD is fully supported.
