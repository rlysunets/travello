        "question": "Do I need travel insurance?",
        "answer": "Although no one likes to spend more money, the truth is that anything can happen when traveling. Trip delays, interruptions, or even cancellations can cause unexpected headaches and expenses, but travel insurance can help make sure you are protected for adjustments you need to overcome these situations. Some plans contain cancellation benefits and if you have a covered reason you can be reimbursed for pre-paid non-refundable expenses, like a medical emergency or loss of employment before your trip even begins. Travello has partnered with Allianz Global Assistance to provide travel insurance."
